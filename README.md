# venmo-transaction-export
Venmo doesn't currently have an export transactions history.

The principle function of this CSV export will be to import to YNAB4, hence the headers as follows outlined [here](http://classic.youneedabudget.com/support/article/csv-file-importing)

#### CSV Headers
Date,Payee,Category,Memo,Outflow,Inflow

examples:
- ` 01/25/12,Sample Payee,,Sample Memo for an outflow,100.00, `
- ` 01/26/12,Sample Payee 2,,Sample memo for an inflow,,500.00 `
